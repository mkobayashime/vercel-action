## Example Usage

### Disable Vercel for GitHub

> The Vercel for GitHub integration automatically deploys your GitHub projects with Vercel, providing Preview Deployment URLs, and automatic Custom Domain updates.
[link](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations)

We would like to to use `github actions` for build and deploy instead of `Vercel`. 

Set `github.enabled: false` in vercel.json

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "public": false,
  "github": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "builds": [
    { "src": "./public/**", "use": "@now/static" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "public/$1" }
  ]
}

```
When set to false, `Vercel for GitHub` will not deploy the given project regardless of the GitHub app being installed.


`vercel.json` Example:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "scope": "amond",
  "public": false,
  "github": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "builds": [
    { "src": "./public/**", "use": "@now/static" }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "public/$1" }
  ]
}
```

### Project Linking

You should link a project via [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) in locally.

When running `vercel` in a directory for the first time, [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) needs to know which scope and Project you want to deploy your directory to. You can choose to either link an existing project or to create a new one.

> NOTE: Project linking requires at least version 17 of [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download). If you have an earlier version, please [update](https://vercel.com/guides/updating-vercel-cli) to the latest version.

```bash
vercel
```

```bash
? Set up and deploy ‚Äú~/web/my-lovely-project‚Äù? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] y
? What‚Äôs the name of your existing project? my-lovely-project
üîó Linked to awesome-team/my-lovely-project (created .vercel and added it to .gitignore)
```

Once set up, a new `.vercel` directory will be added to your directory. The `.vercel` directory contains both the organization(`vercel-org-id`) and project(`vercel-project-id`) id of your project.

```json
{"orgId":"example_org_id","projectId":"example_project_id"}
```

You can save both values in the secrets setting in your repository. Read the [Official documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) if you want further info on how secrets work on Github.

### Github Actions

* This is a complete `.github/workflow/deploy.yml` example.

Set the `vercel-project-id` and `vercel-org-id` you found above.

```yaml
name: deploy website
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v19
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} # Required
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} #Optional 
          vercel-args: '--prod' #Optional
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID}}  #Required
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID}} #Required 
          working-directory: ./sub-directory
```
